Alright so this one I doubt I will use that much for a while at least.
but basically this one is like hey give me a prototype and ill give you another
copy of it. this is mainly used for when you have a massive object, and you are 
storing it on a data base or something. you can pull that object then feed it into
a cloner/copier and it copies all the data in it and returns a replica of it.
