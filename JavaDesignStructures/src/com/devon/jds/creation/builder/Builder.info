The Builder is like a factory more or less but sometimes when you have an object
it will require a load of variables inside of it like lets say a computer for example
what kind of screen, what screen resolution, should there be a camera, whats the storage,
and so on, there can be hundreds of variables really, so the builder compensates for this 
by being having loads of set functions, while only having the absolute necessary stuff in 
the constructor.
