The factory is a pattern which is like saying hey
I really want to make cakes, like loads of them,
so I feed a factory a very basic set of info, or
as i put it a template for the cakes i want, this
might include the frosting, the flavor, etc.
then i call the factory and say hey can i have a cake
please and it returns me a new cake.
